# What is Pairs Trading
Pairs trading is a form of mean-reversion quantitative strategy. In pairs trading, there are two different different equities that are traded and have a very high correlation value associated with each other. The assumption here is that these two equities have a stationary value where they will converge to whenever they begin to diverge. When these equities begin converging to this stationary value, trades are executed related to a short or long position.
